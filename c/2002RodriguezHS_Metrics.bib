abstract={We discuss a generic quality framework, based on a generic model, for evaluating Web processes. The aim is to perform assessment and improvement of web processes by using techniques from empirical software engineering. A web development process can be broadly classified into two almost independent sub-processes: the authoring process (AUTH process) and the process of developing the infrastructure (INF process). The AUTH process concerns the creation and management of the contents of a set of nodes and the way they are linked to produce a web application, whereas the INF development process provides technological support and involves creation of databases, integration of the web application to legacy systems etc. In this paper, we instantiate our generic quality model to the AUTH process and present a measurement framework for this process. We also present a tool support to provide effective guidance to software personnel including developers, managers and quality assurance engineers.},
