abstract="This paper provides an overview of how empirical research can be a valid approach to improve epistemological foundations and ontological representations in Software Engineering (SE). Despite of all the research done in SE, most of the results have not been yet been stated as laws, theories, hypothesis or conjectures, i.e., from an epistemological point of view. This paper explores such facts and advocates that the use of empirical methods can help to improve this situation. Furthermore, it is also imperative for SE experiments to be planned and executed properly in order to be valid epistemologically. Finally, this paper presents some epistemological and ontological results obtained from empirical research in SE.",
