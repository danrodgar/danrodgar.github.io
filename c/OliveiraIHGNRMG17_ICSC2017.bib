abstract={This paper describes the specification, modelling and design of an ontology-based news authoring environment for the Semantic Web, that takes into account the construction and use of an ontology of the Zika disease. CMSs are being adapted in order to receive semantic features, such as automatic generations of keywords, semantic annotation and tagging, content reviewing etc. We present here the infrastructure designed to foster research on semantic CMSs as well as semantic web technologies that can be integrated into an ontology-based news authoring environment.},
