abstract={Unregulated evolution of software often leads to software ageing which not only makes the product difficult to maintain but also breaks the consistency between design and implementation. In such a case, it may become necessary to re-engineer the software so that it becomes maintainable again. In this paper we present the case study of the reengineering of the People Tracking subsystem of a surveillance system written in C++. We discuss the problems, the challenges and the approaches taken, and we show how the re-engineered product is now better maintainable. We also discuss the generation of the relevant artefacts - from requirement document through to design document.},
