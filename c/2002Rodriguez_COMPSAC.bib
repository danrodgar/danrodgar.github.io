abstract={It has been claimed that dynamic prediction models can be used to help project managers make more accurate estimates than static prediction models. However, such a claim needs to be validated so that project managers can use dynamic models with confidence. In this paper we discuss an experiment we conducted in an academic environment that compared a dynamic model using Bayesian belief networks (BBN) with a static model involving the COCOMO and Akiyama models. The results from this experiment in fact validate the above claim. However we suggest replication of this experiment in order to increase confidence to our results.},
