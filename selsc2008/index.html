			<h2>Motivation</h2>
			Computational Science techniques are increasingly being applied in 
			both research institutions and industry to for example, financial 
			applications, bioinformatics applications, physical applications, 
			data mining applications based on grid or clusters etc. As with 
			other disciplines there are specific issues when planning and 
			developing such applications. For example, those applications are 
			generally distributed and based upon Grid environments or clusters 
			with specific management and planning issues, design, testing, etc. 
			This workshop would like analyse to software engineering issues 
			specific to these types of applications such as adaptation of 
			processes for, planning, management, verification and validation, 
			testing, quality measurement, etc. Also, there is also a motivation 
			for further research on the other direction, i.e., the application 
			of computational intelligence techniques to software engineering 
			issues as a result of the creation of large metrics databases 
			collected from software projects. Examples of computational 
			techniques applied to Software Engineering include genetic 
			algorithms, Bayesian networks, system dynamics, visualization, 
			search based software engineering etc. Many emergent issues are 
			subject to research efforts combining both computational techniques 
			and Software Engineering.
