abstract={The design of a Compact Dual-band Equatorial helix antenna using Computational Electromagnetic Methods together with multiobjective optimization algorithms is presented. These antennas are used for Telemetry, Tracking, and Control of satellites from the terrain base station. In order to optimize the parameters an antenna, a simulation–optimization process is shown along a real case study. The parameters of the antenna that fulfills the radiation patterns needed for the communication are obtained using a simulation tool called MONURBS together with two well-known multiobjective algorithms: NSGA-II and SPEA-2. In this paper, a comparison with previous designs and the antenna prototype is presented, showing that this approach can obtain multiple valid solutions and accelerate the design process.},
