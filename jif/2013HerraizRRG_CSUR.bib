 abstract = {After more than 40 years of life, software evolution should be
	considered as a mature field. However, despite such a long history,
	many research questions still remain open, and controversial
	studies about the validity of the laws of software evolution are
	common. During the first part of these 40 years the laws themselves
	evolved to adapt to changes in both the research
	and the software industry environments. This process of
	adaption to new paradigms, standards, and practices stopped
	about 15 years ago, when the laws were revised for the last time.
	However, most controversial studies have been
	raised during this latter period. Based on a systematic and comprehensive
	literature review, in this paper we describe how and when the laws,
	and the software evolution field, evolved. We also address
	the current state of affairs about the validity
	of the laws, how they are perceived by the research community, and
	the developments and challenges that are likely to occur in the coming
	years.}
