abstract = {Microservice-based systems are usually developed according to agile practices like DevOps, which enables rapid and frequent releases to promptly react and adapt to changes. Monitoring is a key enabler for these systems, as they allow to continuously get feedback from the field and support timely and tailored decisions for a quality-driven evolution. In the realm of monitoring tools available for microservices in the DevOps-driven development practice, each with different features, assumptions, and performance, selecting a suitable tool is an as much difficult as impactful task. This article presents the results of a systematic study of the grey literature we performed to identify, classify and analyze the available monitoring tools for DevOps and microservices. We selected and examined a list of 71 monitoring tools, drawing a map of their characteristics, limitations, assumptions, and open challenges, meant to be useful to both researchers and practitioners working in this area. Results are publicly available and replicable. Editor’s note: Open Science material was validated by the Journal of Systems and Software Open Science Board.}
