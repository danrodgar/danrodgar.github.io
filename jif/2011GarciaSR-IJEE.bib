  Abstract                 = {Problem-based learning relies on the use of problems as the fundamental activity driving the learning process, focusing on the application of knowledge to realistic settings. Problems requiring students the design or evaluation of artifacts are a fundamental ingredient of engineering education in diverse fields. In those settings, the effectiveness of instructional design critically relies on the quality of the problems used, which should emphasize the aspects that students usually find difficult to master, so that relevant domain knowledge is exercised during learning activity. The analysis of the errors in student’s solutions to problem assignments can be used as an empirical source of information for the instructional design of problem collections. In this approach, problem design is driven by findings on the kind and frequency of errors. This paper reports the use of such an approach in the domain of heuristic usability evaluation in the context of an introductory Human Computer Interaction course, using the 3C3R model as a framework. The method for data elaboration and the resulting approach to devising problems can be transferred to other domains in which similar high-level design analysis is required.}
