abstract = "Today's IT systems and IT processes must be ready to handle change in an efficient and responsive manner to allow businesses to both evolve and adapt to a changing world. In this paper we describe an approach that consists of using simulation based multi-objective optimization to select optimal ITIL change management process strategies that help IT managers achieve process efficiency as a Critical Success Factor (CSF). A multi-method simulation model, which is based on agent-based and discrete-event simulation paradigms, has been built to simulate the whole process lifecycle, since the change initiation until its closure. As most engineering problems, assuring an efficient delivery of the change management process requires optimizing simultaneously the corresponding Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in which the process-efficiency CSF can be rolled down. In this paper, we show the results of applying two well-known Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms, namely NSGA-II and SPEA2, to obtain a set of optimal solutions for the KPIs associated with delivering process efficiency as a CSF. We also compare the results obtained with the output from the single-objective optimization algorithm provided by the simulation tool. The experimental work included shows how the approach can provide the IT manager with a wide range of high quality solutions to support them in their decision-making towards CSF achievement."
