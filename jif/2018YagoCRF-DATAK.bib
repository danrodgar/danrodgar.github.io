abstract = "Currently, many educational researchers focus on the extraction of information about the learning progress to properly assist students. We present ON-SMMILE, a student-centered and flexible student model which is represented as an ontology network combining information related to (i) students and their knowledge state, (ii) assessments that rely on rubrics and different types of objectives, (iii) units of learning and (iv) information resources previously employed as support for the student model in intelligent virtual environment for training/instruction and here extended. The aim of this work is to design and build methodologically, throughout ontological engineering, the ON-SMMILE model to be used as support of future works closely linked to supervision of student's learning as competence-based recommender system. For this purpose, our model is designed as a set of ontological resources that have been extended, standardized, interrelated and adapted to be used in multiple learning environments. In this paper, we also analyze the available approaches based on instructional design which can be added to ontology network to build the proposed model. As a case study, a chemical experiment in a virtual environment and its instantiation are described in terms of ON-SMMILE."
