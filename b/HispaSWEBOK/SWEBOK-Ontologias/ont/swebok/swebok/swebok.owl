Instances of this collection are distinct from computer code and from both running and installed programs.

More than one instance of ComputerCode can express the same instance of ComputerProgram-CW; for example, a single instance of ComputerProgram-CW can be written in source code (see ComputerCode-Source) in several different computer languages, or it can be complied as a binary executable (see ComputerCode-Binary). A physical instantiation of a ComputerProgram-CW is a ComputerProgramCopy which is an InformationBearingThing and is related to its ComputerProgram-CW by the predicate programCopies.
