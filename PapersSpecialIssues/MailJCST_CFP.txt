Advances in Software Metrics and Software Processes
Special Issue of the Journal of Computer Science and Technology (JCST)
journal - http://jcst.ict.ac.cn/

Motivation

The creation of large empirical databases of software projects as the ISBSG
has stimulated research on estimation models, metrics and methods for
measuring and improving processes and products. This can be viewed as a
consequence on the maturing of the Software Engineering discipline, fostered
also by the creation of the Guide to the Software Engineering Body of
Knowledge (SWEBOK) that emphasizes measurement as the foundation for the
discipline. 

With the inception of such software repositories, many emergent issues
software metrics-related to both products and processes - are subject to
research efforts in Software Engineering. Examples include metrics for open
source development, new metrics for agile methodologies, influence of team
composition and productivity in effort spent, new methods for measuring
functional size such as COSMIC FFP, data mining of software repositories,
visualization techniques of product and process data, techniques for
decision making such as Bayesian networks and system dynamics, etc.

Objectives

The main objective of this special issue would be that of providing a
synthesis of recent advances and findings in Software Engineering
measurement and process issues. Topics of interest include (but are not
limited to) the following areas:

* Software estimates, their validity and the techniques that produce models
of better quality.
* Requirements and Functional Size Measurement: techniques, validity and
their application to new and emerging technologies 
* New metrics and measurement techniques for new paradigms in Software
Engineering such as aspect-oriented metrics, agile methodologies, etc.
* Process and Product Improvement through measurement.
* Decision-making in Software engineering including visualization techniques
for project management
* Data mining of software engineering repositories and Search Based Software
Engineering 
* IT Benchmarking. Standards for the collection, comparison and validation
of metrics
* Software metrics support tools
